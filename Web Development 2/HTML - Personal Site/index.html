<td>  <h1>Hello, I'm Hannah Bergman</h1>
  <h2>Web Developer & Digital Marketing Expert</h2><p>
    I started my web development journey working at a full-service advertising agency out of downtown Dayton, OH as a Digitial Marketing Specialist.<br>
    Working in the agency setting, I was able to delve into many different areas of marketing - including web design, web development, & SEO. <br>
    I found web development to be what I was most passionate about and took interest in learning as much as I could about it!
    <br>
    <br>
    After a few years of independent learning, I decided to go back to college to pursue a 2nd bachelors degree in computer science through Western Governors University
    <br>
    (an online university that gave me the flexibility to learn at my own pace and balance going to school with working a full-time job).
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm currently at a place where I'm looking to branch away from digital marketing and expand my career and skill set as a web developer further.
    <br>
    I provide a competitive advantage as a well-rounded developer with front-end/back-end experience + a vast array of digital marketing & SEO knowledge.
    <br>
    <br>
    I also consider myself a highly analytical, performance-driven professional and a relentless optimist who believes there is no failure, only feedback.
